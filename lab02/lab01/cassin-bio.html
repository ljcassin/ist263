        I am currently an Applied Data Analytics and Environment, Sustainability, and Policy major. I hope to eventually help inform environmental 
        policy decisions with data analysis. I currently have an internship with a professor on campus where I delineate streams on the Greenland 
        Ice Sheet in QGIS to (in theory) help better understand the rate at which the greenland ice sheet is falling/melting into the sea.  I work two jobs 
        and have an internship so I don't really have a ton of  time to pick up new hobbies but if I did I would learn how to sew! Outside  of work 
        I love to hang out with my friends, cook, and go on walks.My favorite TV show of all time is Girls on HBO. Some of my favorite movies
       are Greenbook, The Martian, Leon The Professional, and Bridesmaids. I work two jobs and have an internship so I don't really have a ton of 
        time to pick up new hobbies but if I did I would learn how to sew! I hate Pelicans and I love yogurt.
