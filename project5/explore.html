                    Green Lakes State Park in Syracuse is renowned for its stunning glacial lakes—Green Lake and Round 
                Lake—nestled within upland forest. These two lakes are meromictic, meaning their deep waters don’t 
                mix with surface waters during fall and spring. This unique condition creates oxygen-free zones in the 
                depths, preserving layers of sediment that offer valuable records of ancient plant and animal life, 
                making the lakes some of the most studied of their kind in the world.
                Formed during the Ice Age, the lakes are believed to be remnants of giant plunge pools carved by 
                massive waterfalls. Nearly half of the water feeding the lakes flows through surrounding bedrock rich in 
                sulfur, calcium, and magnesium. This causes annual “whiting” events—mineral crystallites forming in the 
                water—that give Green Lake its vibrant, striking color.

                    Green Lakes features 15-miles of trails through old growth forests that can be used for hiking, 
                    snowshoeing, and cross-country skiing! 
                    A 12-whole golf course sits on Green Lakes State Park – overlooking both Green and Round Lake. 
                    During warmer months, kayaks are available for rental on Green Lake. Lifeguarded beaches also open 
                    during the summer months, with swimming permitted in designated areas.

                    Green Lakes is home to a plethora of fish, most notably Rainbow Trout, Largemouth Bass, Bluegill, and 
                    Rock Bass. The Department of Environmental Conservation stocks fish in Green Lakes every spring to 
                    increase recreational fishing and restore native species to waters they formerly occupied. 
                    Some other animals to watch for at Green Lakes include Canada Geese, Ducks, Great Blue Herons, 
                    White-tailed Deer, Woodchucks, Racoons, Red and Gray Foxes, Coyotes, and Minks!
                    Over 170 species of birds have been spotted at Green Lakes! Use this checklist to mark all of the birds

                    Green Lakes Bird Conservation Area is a vital sanctuary where diverse bird species—from threatened 
                    Northern Harriers to forest breeders like Ovenbirds—find refuge in its unique mix of grasslands, mature 
                    forests, and meromictic lakes. Facing threats from invasive plants, woody encroachment, and deer 
                    overpopulation, New York State Parks has launched a targeted conservation plan to preserve these 
                    habitats by clearing invasive shrubs, mowing grasslands regularly, managing predators, and controlling 
                    deer populations—ensuring this critical bird haven continues to thrive for generations to come.

                    Barry Park, nestled in Syracuse’s east side, was officially established in 1945 and named in 1957 after 
                    William A. Barry, a Syracuse University engineering alumnus and influential Parks Commissioner who 
                    helped shape the city’s recreational landscape. Originally developed to expand green space for growing 
                    neighborhoods, the 15-acre park has evolved into a beloved community hub, blending nature, sports, 
                    and family-friendly amenities while honoring Barry’s legacy of public service and urban planning vision.

                   Onondaga Lake, sacred to the Onondaga Nation as the ancestral heart of the Haudenosaunee 
Confederacy and birthplace of the Great Law of Peace, has a rich Native American heritage spanning 
over a thousand years. Once a bustling 19th-century tourist spot, the lake suffered severe pollution from 
industrial waste and sewage, leading to swimming bans by 1940 and fishing restrictions by 1970. Lake 
Onondaga became known as “the most polluted site in the country.” Designated a federal Superfund 
site in 1994, extensive cleanup efforts by Honeywell and Onondaga County—including dredging, 
improved wastewater treatment, and runoff control—have restored the lake to its cleanest state in over 
a century. Today, Onondaga Lake supports more than 65 fish species and is reclaiming its role as a 
cherished natural and cultural resource, bridging its profound indigenous legacy with modern 
environmental renewal.

                    Lake Onondaga has four trails that make up an 8.2-mile loop around the entire lake.
                    Wegman’s landing, located on the northeast side of the lake, includes pickleball courts, a playground, 
                    and a 16,000 sqft Skate Park.
                    In a similar area, the Griffon Visitor Center offers shuffleboard, bocce, and volleyball courts for public 
                    use.

                    Outside of the water, mink, herons, beavers, turtles, egrets, osprey, and more also rely on the lake for 
                    food, nesting, and habitat.

                    <u>The Onondaga Lake Conservation Corps</u>
                    The Onondaga Lake Conservation Corps (OLCC) is a volunteer-driven initiative founded in 2012 to 
                    restore and protect wildlife habitats around Onondaga Lake, a designated Audubon Important Bird Area. 
                    Supported by partners like Honeywell, Audubon New York, and local organizations, the Corps engages 
                    community members in hands-on restoration projects—such as planting native species and removing 
                    invasives—to improve habitat for birds like Bald Eagles and waterfowl. Through educational programs, 
                    public events, and classroom activities, OLCC fosters environmental stewardship and helps reconnect 
                    people with the lake’s ecological and cultural significance.
                    <u>The Environmental Protection Agency </u>
                    Since its designation as a Superfund site in 1994, Onondaga Lake has undergone a comprehensive 
                    cleanup led by Honeywell under EPA and New York State supervision, with investments totaling around 
                    $16.5 million. Major efforts included dredging and removing over 2 million cubic yards of contaminated 
                    sediment from the lakebed, followed by capping to isolate remaining pollutants. Restoration focused on 
                    more than 90 acres of wetlands, shoreline, and upland habitats, while groundwater treatment systems 
                    and upgrades to stormwater and wastewater infrastructure helped reduce ongoing pollution.
