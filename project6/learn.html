            <p> Invasive species are non-native plants, insects, and animals that disrupt New York’s natural ecosystems
by outcompeting native species and altering habitats. They spread quickly and can cause significant
environmental and economic damage, threatening the health of forests, wetlands, and wildlife.
Managing these invaders requires early detection, public awareness, and coordinated efforts to control
their spread and protect native biodiversity. Preserving the balance of these ecosystems is crucial for the
state’s environmental health and the services nature provides to communities.</p>

                    <p> 
                        Invasive species often spread unintentionally through human activity—especially when outdoor gear, vehicles, or pets carry seeds, eggs, or plant fragments into new areas.
To prevent their spread, visitors to parks and natural areas should follow a few key practices.

                        To prevent the spread of aquatic invasive species in New York, boaters must follow the Clean,
                    Drain, Dry protocol:
                    • Clean: Remove all mud, plants, and animals from boats, trailers, and gear. Use hot water
                    or visit a decontamination station if needed.
                    • Drain: Empty all water from compartments like bilges, live wells, and ballast tanks
                    before leaving the launch site.
                    • Dry: Let all equipment dry completely—ideally for 5–7 days—before using it in another
                    waterbody.
                    • Disinfect: If drying isn’t possible, soak gear in water at least 140°F for 30 seconds.
                    This process is required by law in the Adirondack region and strongly encouraged statewide to
                    protect lakes, rivers, and native wildlife.

                        To prevent the spread of invasive pests, don’t move untreated firewood in New York State:
                        • Buy local: Always purchase firewood near where you’ll burn it—ideally within 10 miles.
                        • Use certified heat-treated wood: Look for firewood labeled as treated to kill pests.
                        • Leave it behind: Don’t bring leftover firewood home or to another location.
                        • It’s the law: Moving untreated firewood more than 50 miles is illegal in New York.
                        Invasive insects and diseases often hitchhike in firewood, threatening forests and native species
                        statewide.

                        To prevent the spread of aquatic invasive species, aquarium and pet owners in New York should
                        follow these key guidelines:
                            • Never release pets or plants: Don’t dump aquarium contents into local waterways or
                            flush them down drains.
                            • Choose responsibly: Buy non-invasive species and avoid those banned or regulated in
                            New York.
                            • Dispose properly: Freeze or bag unwanted plants and animals before placing them in
                            the trash.
                            • Spread the word: Educate others about the risks of releasing aquarium species into the
                            wild.
                        Even small releases can cause big ecological damage—responsible pet ownership helps protect
                        native habitats.

                    To prevent the spread of terrestrial invasive species in New York, follow these key practices:
                        • Stay on trails: Avoid disturbing soil and vegetation that may harbor invasive seeds or
                        pests.
                        • Clean gear and vehicles: Remove mud, seeds, and plant material from boots, bikes,
                        pets, and equipment before and after outdoor activities.
                        • Don’t move firewood: Buy firewood locally and use certified heat-treated wood to
                        avoid transporting invasive insects.
                        • Use native plants: Choose non-invasive species for landscaping and habitat restoration.
                        • Report sightings: If you spot a suspected invasive species, report it to iMapInvasives or
                        local authorities.
                    These simple actions help protect New York’s forests, parks, and natural areas from ecological
                    damage.
